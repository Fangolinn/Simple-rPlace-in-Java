## End of semester project for "Client-Server Programming" class 

Semester 6 at WIT Academy | class code 'PAP'

# Project description

Simple Java implementation of r/place.

_During the development I went through an intermediate step of creating a simplified chat app when learning how to effectively send messages between client and server. That I kept here as a separate branch **because why not**._
